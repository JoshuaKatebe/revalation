✨ Design Concept for Revealed Armor

🛡️ Brand Identity & Visual Style

Theme: Spiritual empowerment, divine protection, and personal revelation.

Color Palette:

Deep Charcoal or Midnight Blue: Symbolizes strength and mystery.

Gold or Bronze Accents: Evokes armor and royalty (divine inheritance).

White & Light Beige: Clean, holy, and minimal — great for contrast and readability.

Typography:

Bold Serif for headers (e.g., “I AM BLESSED”): Feels timeless and scriptural.

Clean Sans-serif for body text: Modern and easy to read.

Imagery:

Lifestyle shots like the ones you uploaded — real people wearing the gear, smiling, standing strong.

Subtle overlays of scripture references or armor motifs (e.g., shield, sword, helmet).
